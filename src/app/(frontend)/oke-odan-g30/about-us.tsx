        The birth of Oke-Odan G30 or Group of Thirty was brought to life in January 2023. Initially,
        invitations were extended to selected sons, daughters, and friends of Oke-Odan who have the
        interest of Oke-Odan in their hearts. The invitation was formally extended to only 21
        members, then later decided to extend to more members total 30 members. Oke-Odan Group of 30
        or G30 is the premier forum of Oke-Odan elites ready for the challenge call to Oke-Odan. It
        is the responsibility of Oke-Odan G30 or Group to secure and strengthen the SOCECOSEC
        achievements for Oke-Odan. (Soc-Eco-Sec means Social/Economy/Security). We believe that
        Oke-Odan has so many sons and daughters who are willing and ready to serve just as we are
        ready to serve. Therefore, we would like to thank each one of us for accepting this call to
        Oke-Odan. We will also encourage each one of us to see this opportunity as an honor and
